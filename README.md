# Singapore Resale Flat Prices Prediction

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the resale prices of flats in Singapore. The model will be deployed as a user-friendly web application, allowing users to estimate the resale value of a flat based on various factors such as location, flat type, floor area, and lease duration. The application will assist both potential buyers and sellers in making informed decisions in the competitive Singapore real estate market.

## Skills and Technologies

- **Data Wrangling**
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- **Model Building**
- **Model Deployment**
- **Streamlit** (for web application development)
- **Render** (for deployment)
- **Python** (including libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn)

## Domain

- **Real Estate**

## Problem Statement

The objective of this project is to create a machine learning model that predicts the resale prices of flats in Singapore using historical transaction data. The predictive model will provide users with an estimated resale price based on various factors, aiding in the buying and selling process.

## Motivation

Estimating the resale value of a flat in Singapore's competitive market can be challenging due to numerous influencing factors. This project seeks to provide a solution by offering a predictive model that delivers accurate estimates based on historical data.

## Scope

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**
   - Collect data from the Singapore Housing and Development Board (HDB) for the years 1990 to present.
   - Clean and structure the data for machine learning.

2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Extract and create relevant features including town, flat type, storey range, floor area, flat model, and lease commence date.

3. **Model Selection and Training**
   - Choose and train a regression model (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, or random forests).
   - Evaluate the model using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R2 Score.

4. **Streamlit Web Application**
   - Develop a web application using Streamlit to allow users to input flat details and receive resale price predictions.

5. **Deployment**
   - Deploy the Streamlit application on Render or another cloud platform to make it accessible online.

6. **Testing and Validation**
   - Test the application thoroughly to ensure accurate predictions and functionality.

## Deliverables

- A well-trained machine learning model for predicting resale prices.
- A user-friendly web application built with Streamlit, deployed on Render or any cloud platform.
- Documentation and instructions for using the application.
- A comprehensive project report detailing data analysis, model development, and deployment processes.
